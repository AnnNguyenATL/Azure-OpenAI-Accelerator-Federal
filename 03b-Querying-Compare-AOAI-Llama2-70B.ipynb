            "Content: Abstract Background and aims As mental health services in outpatient medical clinics expand, psychiatrists must be trained to practice in these settings. The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (ACLP) residency education subcommittee convened a writing group with the goal of summarizing the current evidence about outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and providing a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. Method MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and PsycINFO (via OVID), were reviewed each from inception to December 2019, for psychiatric CLP services in ambulatory settings that involved residents or fellows. The CLP education guidelines were reviewed for recommendations relevant to outpatient CLP. We also searched MedEd portal for published curriculums relevant to CLP. The group held 2 conferences to reach consensus about recommendations in setting up outpatient CLP rotations. Results Seventeen articles, three ACLP supported guidelines, and eight online didactic resources were identified as directly reporting on the organization and/or impact of an outpatient CLP rotation. These manuscripts indicated that residents found outpatient CLP rotations effective and relevant to their future careers. However, the literature provided few recommendations for establishing formal outpatient CLP training experiences. Discussion Outpatient CLP rotations offer multiple benefits for trainees, including exposure to specific clinical scenarios and therapeutic interventions applicable only in the outpatient setting, increased continuity of care and the unique experience of providing liaison and education to non-mental health providers. The article outlines recommendations and examples for developing outpatient CLP rotations which CLP educators can incorporate in their programs.\n",

            "Content: Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) is a novel sepsis inflammatory mediator and C23 is a putative CIRP competitive inhibitor. Therefore, we hypothesized that C23 can ameliorate sepsis-associated injury to the lungs and kidneys. First, we confirmed that C23 dose-dependently inhibited TNF-α release, IκBα degradation, and NF-κB nuclear translocation in macrophages stimulated with CIRP. Next, we observed that male C57BL/6 mice treated with C23 (8 mg/kg BW) at 2 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) had lower serum levels of LDH, ALT, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β (reduced by ≥39%) at 20 h after CLP compared with mice treated with vehicle. C23-treated mice also had improved lung histology, less TUNEL-positive cells, lower serum levels of creatinine (34%) and BUN (26%), and lower kidney expression of NGAL (50%) and KIM-1 (86%). C23-treated mice also had reduced lung and kidney levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. E-selectin and ICAM-1 mRNA was significantly lower in C23-treated mice. The 10-day survival after CLP of vehicle-treated mice was 55%, while that of C23-treated mice was 85%. In summary, C23 decreased systemic, lung, and kidney injury and inflammation, and improved the survival rate after CLP, suggesting that it may be developed as a new treatment for sepsis.\n",

            "Content: The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1/CC chemokine ligand 2 (MCP-1/CCL2) is a potent chemoattractant of mononuclear cells and a regulatory mediator involved in a variety of inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we demonstrate that mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide and to polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) when compared with wild-type mice. Interestingly, in the CLP model, mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice efficiently cleared the bacteria despite an impaired recruitment of leukocytes, especially mononuclear cells. The increased lethality rate in these models correlates with an impaired production of interleukin (IL) 10 in vivo. Furthermore, macrophages from mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice activated with lipopolysaccharide also produced lower amounts of IL-10 and similar tumor necrosis factor compared with wild-type mice. We observed a drastic increase in the amounts of macrophage migration inhibitory factor at 6 and 24 h after CLP in mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice. These results indicate that endogenous MCP-1/CCL2 positively regulates IL-10 but negatively controls macrophage migration inhibitory factor during peritoneal sepsis, thus suggesting an important immunomodulatory role for MCP-1/CCL2 in controlling the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in sepsis.\n",
